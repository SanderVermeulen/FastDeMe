# Project-UU
Repo voor interne veranderingen voor main release bioinformatica pipeline project UU

Update 6-12-2018:
Fixed a crash when inputting files with their filepath (/path/to/file/example.fastq)
Fixed an issue were some files would be put in program folder instead of input file folder
All files now are put in the folder where the input files are located

To do:
Let user choose own destination folder
Not all uncessary files are correctly deleted at the when the program finishes
When using a prefix, all files are output to program folder
